    <h1>WW2 Battle Locations</h1>
    
    <p>This is a map I made for App Academy. The locations are based on WW2 battlefields. On this project we were able to choose to make it on whatever topic so I decided to do WW2 because it has something to do with U.S. History and I just enjoyed working on it. We used the Google maps API to actually put the map on the screen. This map includes some famous battles that took place during the second world war. In the future I am planning on adding more locations and possibly animations on the pinpoints. </p>
