        <h1>Sonnet</h1>
    <p>This is a Sonnet that I wrote for my tenth grade English class. It is about my everyday life during the school day. I write about what I do at school and what I do when I get home. I feel that it really brought out my poetic side and I had fun writing it. </p>
    <h2>The Life of Gerardo</h2>
    <p class="poem">Wake up at seven o'clock,to get ready</br>
Teeth brushed, clothes on, and ready to takeoff</br>
Can not wait to see my little Eddie</br>
I truly hate school, but it will payoff</br>
Trying to get sleep in advisory</br>
Bell rings, time to begin my awful day</br>
Need help with sonnet, head to library</br>
Earbuds in ear listening to Pompeii</br>
Last class of the day; Mr. Carcido</br>
Start taking notes and already tired</br>
Assessments shot at me like torpedos</br>
Last bell rings at last same time as prior</br>
In car heading back home just want to sleep</br>
Open bedroom door and start counting sheep.</br> 
</p>
