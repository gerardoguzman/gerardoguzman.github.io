       <h1>Gerardo Guzman Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. I'm glad you are here. My name is Gerardo Guzman and I am an 11th grader attending Pasadena High School. I am currently in the App Academy Pathway. During my time at Pasadena High School I have developed many skills and interests. One of those interests is History. Preferably U.S. History because it makes me ask myself more questions on the topic and think more. I tend to ask myself questions such as, "What would it feel like to be alive during this period?" This really helps me think more on the topic. Apart from school my other interests are hanging out with friends, playing videogames, and being outdoor with the nature. If I had to say something I am so proud of it would have to be a couple of the games and websites I have created. I pride myself in doing these because I never actually thought I would create one and at this point I have made a handfull. A skill I have a mutual relationship with is my height. It has it's advantages and disadvantages. I really hope you enjoy my portfolio website.</p>
